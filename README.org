* what it does

launch a process (like a local webdev server) and open an electron =BrowserWindow= to it

* usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
http://localhost:8000 python -m SimpleHTTPServer
#+END_SRC

* why?

and how is this different from running =python -m SimpleHTTPServer= and opening [[http://localhost:8000]] in the browser?

it's not; in fact it's probably worse, because =BrowserWindow= lacks basic browser functions.

but it saves you a few steps :-)))
